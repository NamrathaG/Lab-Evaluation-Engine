# Lab-Evaluation-Engine

The project is primarily a Lab Evaluation Engine with group chat feature. It lets the teacher (server) send a question to all the students (clients). The students write a C program to solve the question and check for errors before sending it to the teacher. The teacher evaluates all the codes and grades the students. The clients i.e students can discuss while solving the problem thus paving way for efficient solutions.
